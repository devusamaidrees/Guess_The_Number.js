This is a simple guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 0 and 99, and the user has to guess the number.
# Code Description
The program uses the **prompt-sync** package to prompt the user to enter a number. The **Math.random()** function is used to generate a random number between 0 and 99. The program then enters a **while loop**, which runs until the user guesses the correct number. The user's guess is compared to the randomly generated number, and the program tells the user if their guess is too high or too low. The program keeps track of the number of attempts the user has made, and once the user guesses the correct number, the program prints the number of attempts it took the user to guess the correct number.
